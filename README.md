# gpgcat
This is me trying to make a cat-like GPG thing. It mostly handles the for loops needed to do something like this, it's not expected to be so crazy to use.

I recommend you have a key agent enabled, so you aren't asked a million times in a row to enter your key if you are decrypting something.
